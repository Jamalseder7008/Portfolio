                Computer science is derived through math and logic, without one or the other the entire foundation of computer science is bound 
                to crumble. Thankfully, our entire livelihood exists upon the foundation of truth. In order to discover more truth, we use 
                computer science to compute many problems, some much more complex than others. A simple problem that takes approximately 
                polynomial time will fall under the “P” category discussed in the essay “The status of the P vs NP problem”. 
                The problems that are not so simple and require much more computational energy are NP problems, and these problems sometimes 
                require more computational power than we actually have. So as computer scientists we want to be able to solve everything, 
                however, as human beings we must understand that if we are to live in truth and to live within logic then we must accept that 
                there is a realm of hidden knowledge. Although the realm of “The Hidden” is beyond the scope of this essay the concept that 
                must be realized still applies; Even if the knowledge is not available to us at this moment, we must acknowledge its existence so 
                as to remain logical in hopes of one day accepting the truth. P=NP vs P!=NP has requirements that must be met for us to determine 
                its final boolean value, what rather is a more looming danger is the people that are very bound on one being true and the other 
                being false, by accepting an answer that they lack the required prerequisite knowledge to answer. 
            </p>
            <p class="tab">
                Maybe after a universal acceptance of that knowledge being outside of our reach, just as a curtain hides that which is in 
                direct sight, that curtain may be revealed and that which is hidden will become known. The way we can look at NP is like a 
                sudoku puzzle, there are many ways to check if it is correct, “verifiable”, however it takes a long time to solve it. 
                This solution was within the Hidden realm before it was solved, not to say that it was in the future, because if it was not 
                solved it would still remain in the Hidden and not in the future. This is to say that the NP,nondeterministic polynomial, 
                problem set, does not have to be solved within our Time to be considered equal to P rather it must simply exist within truth. 
                If the result of P is true and the result of NP is true then we must accept that P can in at least one form equal to NP. 
                For us to expect that all of NP = P in every scenario is an odd request considering the very lengths this may reach, for 
                example to check if 1 = one we must check every instance for 1 to ever exist and replace it with one; that replacement if 
                we want 1=one to hold true must not create any falsehood and must only result in truth if that was the initial state. 
                All in all, P might very well equal NP, we just do not have the necessary information required to answer that question.
