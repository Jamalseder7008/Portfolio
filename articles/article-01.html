                Read and the merciful doors of your lord will open. A path to wonderful stories to come and their magnificent beauty. 
                Many adventures that a soul will embark on wherein it will learn the truth. The truth of its ultimate reality. 
                The reality that must be realized as an ever-evolving subject. Why is it considered a subject? 
                It is a subject because it must submit to continue onto the correct path. Without submission, there is no movement and that path rather becomes a place.  
                Look back, smile, and reflect. There is light, and there is more beauty. Now look ahead and move in the direction that is brighter. 
                Realize that we are still on that same path, yet once we reflect that path is more refined. This is what is known as building an intention. 
                Intentions shape the space with the straight path, it does not curve nor does it become obscure, rather it becomes painted in beauty unlike any other. 
                There are stars in the distance, stars within sight yet out of reach, within the stars there are flashes of moments.
                 Could these moments be our memories to come or our memories of the past? Nay, rather it is a mix of both.  
                 Now reflect, we have avoided looking at any memories except a couple, one of love and one of a path. 
                 There is a memory of motherly love and the white path.

                Those glorious doors we have just entered are the doors of our heart and mind, they are one in conjunction. 
                We can attempt to separate them however let us keep them merged with the intention of unity. 
                Unity builds this reality that our subject has continued upon to the point of completion. 
                The idea of love is the one we deeply desire to complete. Why is love such a powerful feeling? 
                Love is spoken about by many yet it is not a formula that the schools developed an algorithm to produce. Rather love is learned through experience. 
                There is a type of love that is deeply fulfilling while other types of love that satisfy to an extent.

                <li>Intrinsic Love</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="tab">
                Love does not have to be separated; rather it is all one love, each aspect of love can be nurtured similar to the way a flower blooms wherein all its beauty becomes revealed. 
                Conditional Love is a love that comes as events unfold and a reliance upon a person or event takes place. 
                Intrinsic Love is an inner love that is rather unconditional and it does not diminish, it is unconditional in that regardless of what happens the love will exist amongst us.
