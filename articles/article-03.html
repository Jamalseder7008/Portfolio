                In order to schedule an event, we must discover the time we want to hold the event without obstructing on other events and at the same 
                moment, displaying that event in a way where users can uncover the necessary information. Here we have a clear problem that must be solved; 
                specifically a constraint satisfaction problem, CSP. My team will work together to develop a working prototype that can be applied to scheduling
                audits within our University, able to be used by professors in a simple manner. This project will require the use of Front-end, Back-end, and 
                Artificial Intelligence algorithms to construct a full-stack application.
