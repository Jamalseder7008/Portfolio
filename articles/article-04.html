            <h1 class='display-1 mt-4'> The Purpose of Using Technology </h1>
            <hr>
            <p class="tab">
               Our purpose throughout using technology is to do good deeds and prohibit evil. I preface with the purpose of the use of technology for the very specific reason of exclaiming its importance. Technology is a branch of study that involves the use of machinery, oftentimes with electricity or engineering, in applied sciences, to solve a problem or promote an answer. To present a paper on the topic of technology is not an act that is to be taken lightly, for it in itself can be a catalyst for carving the path to success. Therefore, all ideas must be backed up with extensive sources and must also require that all presentations of evidence are of sound reason. To do so, the specification that true means correct, right, honest, and true and also that false means incorrect, wrong, dishonest, and false must be defined respectively. Thus, I expect to make clear to you the purpose of our use of technology and that this purpose is to remain true throughout its use, otherwise, our specification of purpose may be falsified. Therefore let us encourage one another toward good and prohibit evil throughout this vast field of study.
          </p>
          <p class="tab">
              Primarily we must begin by stating the importance of the scholars of the ethical standards among the people of the world and those will be considered figureheads of the people as a foundation of discourse. What do I mean by a foundation of discourse? Specifically, when we are approaching a problem in the computer science and technology field, or any field for that matter, we establish as a people, a discourse center that disputes any falsehood and maintains the truth. Today these discourse centers will be classrooms and the scholars will be the teachers. There is a balance that must be recognized, and that balance is the fact that we must value the words said by the people and their truthfulness more than which person is saying those words, yet who has said what will also be acknowledged. If someone has erred or made a mistake then it is up to the listener to, at the correct time, refute reasonably and accept the correct response. Therefore we have a constructed path of truth that will build as time progresses with more and more discussion reinforcing truth and forbidding falsehood. This balance of truthfulness is maintained throughout existence and we must protect it from the fluctuation of human emotions, meaning we do not accept the idea of a scholar solely because we like how he or she said the idea or that it only helps with this situation and is, in fact, wrong with all other situations; rather the application of ideas are strong whence they are universal. Therefore, I am here to advise and to be advised, if I do right then encourage me and if I do wrong then counsel me. If I do not respect my obligations set upon me by Allah, then I have no right for you to adhere to even my ideas.
          </p>
          <p class="tab">
            “Enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong” [3:104]1 is a purpose proclaimed in the Quran, a criterion for the people. Presenting communication through internet servers as an example of this idea to advise; one may ask how must we communicate through an online server, one that is watched by other humans and even one that is not watched by any other humans. The answer is clear utilizing this verse, by explaining to us, myself included, that we must invite to what is right, explaining to one another–the truth--is a clear and obedient response. There are many benefits for the users of the online server if we only speak the truth and also hear the truth, more than I can enumerate. This also enforces that we must forbid what is wrong, one way being, restricting falsehood from coming out of our side of the server. No matter how tempting it is to tell a lie, we must forbid ourselves from presenting false information. Therefore, utilizing technology to spread truth and at the same time, restricting ourselves from spreading falsehood are both excellent ways of inserting and exerting the true purpose of technology. 
          </p>
          <p class="tab">
            Maintenance of relationships is a vast field that attributes to a key point in the purpose of technological communication at an excellent level. In an ethical sense–one of correct character conduct–we have a moral duty to maintain ties with family members as well as our community. The technological expansion has allowed for the seamless integration of communication techniques that have eased relationships exponentially. A message in a letter through the mail that had once taken days, if not weeks, to get to the recipient from the sender has evolved to become an instant messaging system on telephones and emails that allows messages to be received within seconds of launching. And even further within its development, builders have found ways to allow voice messaging which also allows the portrayal of a message to maintain its complete meaning from sender to receiver. Thus presenting more truth and preventing falsehood from being transcribed and memorized.
          </p>
          <p class="tab">
            Advancing the messaging system aligns with our moral purpose of building and maintaining relationships among fellow members of creation and greater, therefore encouraging the effort and mindfulness of technological advancement significantly. If it had not been within our purpose, then it might fall into the bracket of what we as a society may consider “falsehood” and will be hindered from progressing any further, yet technological progression is within our boundaries of purpose and has thus been progressed further. Maintaining relationships is not merely ensuring that a relationship continues to exist, rather it involves the building of new beneficial connections and the destruction of harmful connections. We must use technology to gather resources and information that will allow us to reason as to which relationships must be built, maintained, and destroyed. One example is connecting a family that is overseas to the rest of the family tree. A simple messaging platform can allow for open discussion between the family, with the great possibility of invitations, marriage proposals, new business ventures, and even mental health advancements, all of which contribute greatly to both communities. While another example may be, disconnecting from a server that produces hate and wickedness to protect oneself from hypocrisy. 
          </p>
          <p class="tab">
            Indeed, relationships are beneficial at most times, yet some relationships exist which must be alleviated, and more often than not, the spread of true information allows for the destruction of oppressive relationships. Oppressive relationships are those that include an inducer of oppression unjustly treating a subject. These relationships of oppression cause harm to those being oppressed as well as the onlooking community directly and indirectly. With the use of technology, we can send the correct messages and reveal the correct information to that community to procure the best response that alleviates all oppression and allows for individual and communal growth. The lands affected by this severe oppression are oftentimes subjected to the “Digital Divide,”2 which is the fact that there are regions within the world that are divided from the rest in terms of technological accessibility. Providing the technology specifically to lands affected by the “Digital Divide”2 will greatly impact the growth of a civilization that had otherwise been restricted from accessing necessary information. Currently, this problem of the “Digital Divide”2 raises the clear question: “Why must we even have access to technology?”. The naive answer would be that other people have technology, yet there is a greater answer to that question. We have access to technology to pursue and select the correct knowledge from the best sources where all the facts are true and we can utilize that knowledge to do good deeds that will allow us to group into greater communities that strive towards good and prohibit evil, ultimately increasing the efficiency of seeking knowledge. The correct knowledge will bring about assurance to the masses and alleviate doubt and worry, consequently amplifying trust and happiness throughout a community. The greater sample size of people that join the digital transformation will bring about a positive tilt in the scales of judgment as to the ideas that are available virtually and the ideas that need further clarification–wherein the decision of the majority truly matters. Our aim to combat the “Digital Divide” must be a “Digital Unification,” one that will replace oppression with support and unify communities to spread knowledge throughout the land to a new degree. Placing this great weight on the value of obtaining and providing knowledge is a key pillar within the purpose of our use of technology that will advocate for its continuation at an exponential rate. 
          </p>
          <p class="tab">
            A key messenger in this striving towards “Digital Unification” is the government of each of the lands. The government of any land is set to banish high-handedness and oppression and to let justice and equity prevail.3 Thus, all power and resources are to be utilized for the establishment of prayers, giving of charity, promotion of goodness, and the abolition of evil. And thus each state or administration of government has a foundation of moral values that they adhere to. Utilizing these administrations to communicate with one another all aiming towards this purpose will promote a “Digital Unification” throughout the technological arena. The people must therefore cooperate with their local and distant governments in goodness(regulations of state) and avoid spreading evil in the land. Communication with the state will allow for the spread of new technological advancements that will save others time and money as well as protect them from danger as well as technological transgression. Sending messages between governments about technological progression will unify neighboring lands and promote technological advancement to ease the spread of information and communication throughout. Therefore the purpose of the administration of government is in agreement with the purpose of technology in that it must not only maintain law and order and security of its borders, but also promotion of goodness, rule of justice, and extermination of evils. Just as the government must, technology must maintain a balance between the technology and the individual so that it is not working strictly in an autocratic manner nor grant a degree of unbridled freedom to the individual that may injure the collective interest.3 Doing so will promote the personal growth of each individual within the society whether they be an existing or new member. With the majority working charitably towards the foundational purpose, there will be peace and success. 
          </p>
          <p class="tab">
            One may consider the act of spreading knowledge to be charity. “What is charity?'' one may ask. Charity is the voluntary and obligatory act of giving, often to someone in need, that we as humans take to fulfill our purpose in life. Charity increases the donor and the receiver so much so that the example presented by Allah in the Quran is like a seed that grows seven bushels and within each bushel is one hundred grains, and Allah will increase whom he wills [2:261]1. To focus specifically on how technology can allow human beings to be charitable, we are faced with a plethora of ways as if the paths themselves have multiplied. Software programs are used daily to spread information throughout the world wide web and this information is presented as a form of charity to society. Telling someone a good word, such as encouraging them as they strive towards good is a form of charity. Removing problems, hurt, and hate from the path toward useful information is another act of charity. By allowing information to be more readily accessible, we have witnessed a good deed taking place in a true form. Computer science and technology are lodged firmly in the act of charity so much so that building an effective simple program has the great possibility of being used today and tomorrow consequently bringing about goodness and ease for all users. An example is ‘Quran.com,’ this website allows for the easy playback of the Quran clearly and simply with easy indexing that will teach many users Quranic verses easily. A humble thank you to the makers of that web application and others that have built one similar to it. 
          </p>
          <p class="tab">
            In charity one provides and the other receives, yet we must consider the third. Have you seen the one that prohibits charity out of greed? This my fellow ethical brothers and sisters is an example of wickedness, the one that greedily stores his wealth for no reason. Even worse among them are those that prohibit others from giving charity, indeed we as humans love wealth greatly, yet we must practice reasonable charity and warn those that prohibit charity. Therefore, if someone is to utilize technology to steal, then they have committed wickedness in multiple ways, much of that attributing to the fact that that wealth can have been used towards charity, and for he who has stolen, he has stolen the material wealth and has lost ethically. We must combat those that attribute to that evil of thievery and prohibit charity by speaking up against their oppressive ways. Just as we encourage the good greatly, we must caution against evil greatly. Indeed you will find that those who are righteous believers will be merciful amongst themselves and harsh against evil. Utilizing technology, we can band together and ensure that oppression is suppressed, effectively protecting our community and future generations to come.
          </p>
          <p class="tab">
            The current and future generations must proceed with caution with the actions that they present in this life especially pertaining to technology. In the Quran, we hear from Allah, Whosoever comes with good will receive ten times more similar to that good, yet whosoever comes with evil will not receive except similar to that which he has put forth and they will not be wronged [6:160]1. Therefore, we as humans benefit and suffer from the deeds we exert continuously. Goodness increases exponentially, specifically ten times more with each good presented and that is a mercy upon us; therefore, those that spread good knowledge, through technology, will receive ten beneficial good results as a reward. And those that do evil will bring about more evil unto themselves, although it is not ten times as much it is still there and thus we must be wary of proceeding wickedly today for a better tomorrow. Reminding fellow users to do good and forbid evil is within our purpose in technology for we are then providing true knowledge, a justifiable purpose.
          </p>
          <p class="tab">
            Already it seems as though technology has fulfilled its purpose, yet we have only just begun considering the spread of wealth throughout the community. Businesses and governments today are operating at a large-scale through technological communication infrastructures, one example being international airlines. Airlines are flight providers that transport people and cargo from one land to another, often over great distances and even through clouds safely. Just as there are many layers of clouds, the good deeds that this ease of transportation brings are multilayered. One layer of the use of technology is the airplane structure itself which utilizes equipment and a pilot to reach its destination. Also at that level, the pilot can coordinate with other pilots to avoid disasters through GPS monitoring and communication servers. At another level, the airline can provide information about what destinations will be reached and when along with how many people can travel with them to that location. Then to make matters even better for the nation, consumers can utilize online servers to purchase flight tickets to attend the transportation event. The users are then able to travel to meet family, attend religious pilgrimages, and work over long distances safely and efficiently, thus being a grand example of technology spreading wealth through the community in a way that may be considered a good deed.
          </p>
          <p class="tab">
            Communities are brought together through storefronts and restaurants, especially with the use of technology. Throughout a nation, one can find information about a merchant from their website wherein they promote their business and products in a kind and informative manner. Oftentimes, these merchants become examples for people of the community through their use of technology. For example, once one merchant adopts a POS, or point of sale system, then through their expressed satisfaction of ease, others will follow and utilize that same POS, if not a better one. With technology, there is the potential to build a successful civilization. 
          </p>
          <p class="tab">
            To ensure that a civilization succeeds, leaders must focus on maintaining the education system to its fullest. Therefore, while providing education, the teachers must utilize the best equipment available, software included, to interact with students in the best manner. In turn, this will produce more students that are more knowledgeable about the form of technology and will thus be closer to building a more efficient form whether it be hardware or software. We must also consider that forcing someone to use technology is not aligned with the purpose of technology, rather the right has become clear from the wrong. Consequently, the most useful students will integrate willfully and produce the best results. And thus those who have been forced will be forced to tear down that which they have been forced into, inevitably resulting in more harm. Rather, if we are to find the best technological applications, then the students will look for our community and join willfully. It is as though they will want to learn from us before we consider teaching them. The students will then be the foundation of discourse for the community happily so much so that the next wave of success will be within their generation and those that come after them. The education system itself mixed with technological expeditions is bountiful in terms of charitable work. Therefore, we aim to have a successful education system and our attitude towards technology must be inviting especially if the ends are beneficial for all. 
          </p>
          <p class="tab">
            Therefore, let us remind and remember, for indeed the reminder will benefit us. Our purpose throughout our use of technology is to do good deeds and prohibit evil through our actions and the community’s actions. There will be a constant advancement in the branch of technology that will benefit all people through its leaves and fruits. Allow this field of knowledge to be firmly lodged in truth and the water for this tree of technology to be wisdom. Encourage discussion and reassessment for a constant reevaluation of the purpose with an aim of success and growth. Respect those scholars within the field that promote the correct stance and invite those that are honest to speak up righteously. We hope to benefit within this world and the next by being honest and expressing gratitude. Therefore, strive towards developing programs that will be used in this world and greatly desired in the next. Prohibit the oppression of any individual and speak up against falsehood to remain in line with the purpose of creation in totality not just partially. Protect one another from misinformation by revealing the truth and refuting the false wisely. Change happens over time, therefore if we want to succeed, we must practice patience. Patience will bring about success in all fields of learning and will stimulate discussion throughout our foundation of discourse. Patiently assess that all the information that comes from our hearts and speech are only truthful and useful statements and prohibit our spread of useless knowledge. The technological expansion will continue with you and indeed we humbly invite you to join.
