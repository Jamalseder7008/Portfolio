            <hr>
            <p class="tab">
                "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy" is a psychological treatment that involves a patient suffering from some sort of behavioral disorder. 
                This thesis is a strategy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that involve "Simulated Annealing" to achieve the best results.
                Often times, this behavioral disorder is self-induced through an unhelpful way of thinking regarding a certain behavior or act. 
                These behaviors are often learned habits that are faulty. People pinned by this psychological condition are unknowingly restricted 
                and by engaging in these cognitive treatments, people can learn how to cope with them. In order to engage in these cognitive treatments
                the subject must intend to be aware of why they think about a behavior the way they do, that in turn help the subject to recognize distortions
                that exist. In order to do such a task, we must engage the subject in an extremely dynamic environment, that will allow for changeability of 
                long-term learned habits. This process is similar to a blacksmith subjecting a metal to extreme heat in order to mold its shape to 
                one's liking, a process termed "annealing". To successfully treat a psychological disorder that may have been induced through long-term
                learned habits, we must subject the subject to an intense change in environment that will in turn result in new habits forming, thus 
                termed "Cognitive Behavioral Annealing Therapy".

                I discovered this in the last couple years yet as time has continued and new knowledge has been revealed, we are able to discuss 
                the topic of this theraputic strategy in a more formal and personal manner. I often times engaged in smoking marijuana and then 
                even cigars, not because I thought it to be a bad habit, rather I sincerely believed that I benefitted mentally and physically from doing 
                so. I did not have a specific source of why, I just assumed it did, yet as time progressed, I found myself at a "local maximum", a point of no further
                neighboring progress, and so I needed change. My mental health deteriorated and eventually I was diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder, and 
                schizophrenia, and thus my search for a cure or solution grew. I assessed my habits and picked up new habits while moderating old ones, and 
                soon assessed my smoking habit more seriously. 
            </p>
            <p class="tab">
                Looking at the grass and trees and at the marijuana and cigars, what is so different about these plants. I assumed some are to be watered
                and some are to be burned. What makes me think they are to be watered? Well they grow when they are watered and we benefit from their 
                existence. On the other hand we do not benefit much if the plants are burned, so we must change this behavior of burning the helpful plant.
                Rather we must water the plant and thus we have entered an intense change of environment within the cognitive field of understanding. An 
                object we previously considered must be burned, has now been reevaluated to an object that must be watered and suddenly as I act upon this new 
                behavior, I notice the clouds and how much more satisfied I have become with this new habit of thinking. So much so that it rehabilitated me 
                and has allieviated any preexisting need for smoking, an incredible discovery indeed. It is as if we must induce a mental annealing process 
                to make beneficial drastic change in order to achieve a "global maximum" in success and happiness.
            </p>
            <p class="tab">
                Therefore, continuously reevaluate your habits, there may be a habit there that has you stuck at a local maximum when in reality we all 
                aim to be at a global maximum or higher. There are many strategies for engaging in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, yet by ensuring that 
                there is an intense change in environment and recognizing the local and global minimums and maximums, we are able to encourage change 
                within ourselves and our communities. And endure with patience and faith, for indeed the patient and faithful are those that are successful.
